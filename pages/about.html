        <h2>About Axiom Bot</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm the creator of Axiom Bot. I've paid for, tested, and
          studied many Discord bots and services, but I wanted something truly
          different. This project is my passion, and my goal is to build
          something unique, friendly, and useful for everyone.
        </p>

          We don’t ask for donations for Axiom. If you like what you see and
          feel inspired to help, consider supporting people in need instead —
          food, shelter, and care make a real difference. We’ve gathered some
          trusted options on our
          <a href="donates.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donations page</a>.
